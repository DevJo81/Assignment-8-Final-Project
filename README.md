# COVID-19 Data Analysis: A Comparative Study of the United States,  India and Kenya 📊

## 📋 Project Overview

This project presents a comparative data analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic across three countries — the United States, India, and Kenya — using the Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset. The notebook explores trends in case numbers, death rates, daily new cases, vaccination rollouts, and vaccination coverage as a percentage of the population.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyze the spread and impact of COVID-19 over time in the three countries
- Compare total cases, total deaths, and daily new cases
- Investigate death rates and how they changed across waves
- Examine cumulative vaccination rollouts and population coverage
- Highlight disparities in pandemic response and vaccine access

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

### Core Libraries

- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: Numerical computing
- **matplotlib**: Basic data visualization
- **seaborn**: Advanced statistical visualizations
- **jupyter**: Interactive notebook environment
- **python**

### Data Sources
- Our World in Data (OWID) COVID-19 Dataset (CSV format)

## Project Highlights
- The U.S. recorded the highest total cases and deaths with multiple waves.
- India had distinct infection surges and a large-scale vaccination campaign.
- Kenya reported fewer cases and deaths, with a slower vaccination rollout.
- The U.S. reached ~80% vaccination coverage, India ~72%, and Kenya ~27%.

## 🚀 Getting Started
